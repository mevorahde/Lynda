Common Data Structures:
    - Arrays
        + Collection of elements identified by index or key
        + Array Operations:
            * Calculate item index: O(1)
            * Insert or delete item at the beginning: O(n)
            * Insert or delete item in middle: O(n)
            * Insert or delete item at the end: O(1)
    - Linked Lists
        + Collection of data elements, called nodes
        + Contain reference to the next node in the list
        + Hold whatever data the application needs
        + Elements can be easily inserted and removed
        + Underlying memory doesn't need to be reorganized
        + Drawback: Can't do constant-time random item access
        + Item lookup is linear in time complexity (O(n))


Stacks an Queues
Stack: Collection that supports push and pop operations. They are last-in, first-out data structure.
- Expression processing
- Backtracking: browser back stack
Queue: Collection that supports adding and removing. First item added is the first item out.
- Order processing
- Messaging

Hash Table
- Can also be termed as a dictionary. Maps keys to values using a 'Hash Function.'
Advantage:
- Key to value mappings are unique
- Hash tables are typically very fast

Disadvantage:
- For small data sets, arrays are usually more efficient
- Hash tables don't order entries in a predictable way
